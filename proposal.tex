\section*{Abstract}
With the evolution of internet and popularity of social media, it has become the most prominent and dominent source of information sharing and communication. A person's perference can be determined using his/her social media. Hence based on this information about his/her profile related content can be delievered to the user.\\
Therefore we have come with ``\textbf{Social Media Profile Based Music Recommendation System}''. This project mainly concentrates on the recommendation of the music based on the preference of the user which basically consists ofthe three parts as input,process and output. In input part, the system takesuser data fetched from the social media and information about the music. In the processing media, the userdata and music data are analyzed for the recommender system(content based and collaborative filtering). Similarly, in the output part, it recommends the music to the user.

\section{Introduction}
	``\textbf{Social Media Profile Based Music Recommendation}'' is the system to recommend the music to the users based his/her preference which is obtained from the social media. In this contemporary era of digital technologies, social media has become one of the prominent means for information sharing and communication. Likewise music has been one of the prominent market of entertainment. People listen to music everyday. The fact that music can blend with any emotion has made it's way to different sorts of people with different sorts of personality.\\
	Hence we have come up with the system to recommend the music to a different people based on their social media profiles.

\section{Feasibility Study Report}
	Feasibility of the project has been sub-divided into the further three components and are presented as:\\
	\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
	Since the end product is a website to recommend music to the user based on their social profiles, the proposed system requires the use of internet which are readily available across many countries. Hence the proposed system is operationally feasible.
	\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
	As the technical specification of the software is a computer and internet which are readily available along with the data(music and social media profiles), our system is technically feasible.
	\subsection{Economic Feasibility}
	After the cost analysis of the system regarding the implementation cost, technical cost we can conclude the system is economically feasible as well.

\section{Objective of the Project}
The primary objective of the project is to design, develop and implement a fully functional system to recommend user the music based on his/her social media profile. The whole process of creating system is intended to be achieved through a series of minor procedures, which can be further subdivided into two major stages.\\
The first involved the problem study, solution proposition, designing, developement and system installation. The second phase include the acutal operation, solution of obsolescence problems and progress toward the new standards.\subsection{Stage 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To make it easier for social media user to get information about musci based on their personal preference.
	\item To design and implement simple, informative and easy to use user interface.
	\item To design and develope the system according to the people's need using the latest available technology.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Stage 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To implement the system for the access to the real world.
	\item Consolidating the sytem by removing the trival features and small as well as big bugs.
	\item Removing the obsolescene problems.
	\item To revise the system according to the need and change of standard in use.
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Proposed System}
	The propsed system will be able to recommed the user based on their social media profiles, saving the actual precious time of the users for searching the music of their choice. We have proposed a system that bascially has the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recommendation of the music based on the social media profile.
	\item Elimination of the search for the right music.
	\item Provision for the easy access to music.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Project Description}
The proposed system provides the user with the recommendation of the music bbased on the social media profiles replacing the conventional method of seraching the music of the right chocie.
Our sytem comprises of the two yet interdependent subsystems.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Front End \\
		It is the visible part of the system. The user will interact with this part of the system. It offers the GUI for the interaction and consists of login, recommedation of music based on the social media profile.
	\item Back End \\
		This is the part of the system where all user and music items profiles are stored. Every processing work that is to be done will be done by the back end of the system. This unit is handled by the admin/developers who are responsible for the addition, modification, updating the content of the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\cleardoublepage
\subsection{Design Approach}
The proposed system is intended to be developed with the \textbf{``Incremental Developement Approach''}. Thus proposed system is expected to be evolved through the several versions until complete system has been developed interleaving the activity of specification, developement and validation.

\subsection{Primary/Secondary Source of Data Collection}
The data set used in our system are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User's profile\\
  It will be extracted from facebook API
\item Music data set\\
  It will be extracted from Million Song Dataset from kaggle. \\
  Available Features of Music data set are :
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item List of Artist and Titles
  \item Track-level tags and similar tracks
  \item Music Lyrics
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected Outcomes/Result}
The system is expected to recommed the music to the social media users based on their's proiles.
\subsection{Achievements and Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The major advantage the people will receive the system is to easy access to the right music of their choice eliminating the conventional method of searching the right music. 
\end{itemize}
\cleardoublepage

\section{Present Scope and Future Improvement}
\subsection{Present Scope}
The most important scope of this project will be to act as a prototype to recommend music to the social media users based on their profiles.
\subsection{Future Improvement}
The major enhancement that can be done to a system can be acheived by making the system \textbf{``Feed Recommendation System''}. The feed might include the movies,sports, news, weather news etc.\\
Besides the system can also have the mobile application to interact with the system as smartphones are popular these days.
\cleardoublepage

\section{Conclusion}
\cleardoublepage
Thus after the completion of the project, we will be able to make a recommendation system to the social media users based on their profiles eliminating the conventional method of searching the music of the choice.
